#  What is the origin of the Red88 foxwoods poker game?

In 1988, four friends from Connecticut — Bill Edler, Mike Long, Ray Wolff and Norm Clark — pooled their money to start a poker game at the Foxwoods Resort Casino. At the time, casino poker was a new phenomenon, and the players were excited to find a game they could all afford to play. "We were just four guys looking to gamble," Wolff said.

They named the game Red88 because of the $10 buy-in and $8 minimum bet. The game grew quickly, and soon there were dozens of players vying for seats. "It was like a little club," Clark said.

The original Red88 game is still played today at Foxwoods, with a $1/$2 blind structure and occasional big-money tournaments. "It's evolved over the years, but it's still essentially the same game," Wolff said.

Edler, Long, Wolff and Clark have all since passed away, but their legacy lives on in the popularity of Red88 poker.

#  How does the game work?

The game of Jenga is played by first removing one block from the tower, and then stacking it on top. This is repeated until the tower falls.

If you are playing with two people, the first player removes a block and places it in front of them. The second player then removes a block and places it in front of them. Players then alternate taking turns removing blocks until the tower falls.
