#  What is kubet?

kubet is a Kubernetes tool that speeds up the deployment of applications on Kubernetes. It enables you to easily launch, configure, and manage Kubernetes clusters from your laptop.

# How does kubet work?

kubet is based on the “Kubernetes Operator” concept. An operator is a piece of software that automates the management of resources in a Kubernetes cluster. kubet uses this concept to automate the deployment of applications on Kubernetes. It first discovers the resources required to deploy an application, then creates and configures the appropriate Kubernetes objects to deploy the application.

# What are the benefits of using kubet?

Some of the benefits of using kubet include:

* Easier deployment of applications on Kubernetes. kubet automates the process of deploying applications on Kubernetes, so there is no need to learn how to use Kubernetes or write YAML configurations.

* Faster time-to-production. With kubet, you can quickly create and deploy applications on a Kubernetes cluster without having to wait for someone else to do it for you. This can speed up your time-to-production by weeks or even months.

* Increased efficiency and reproducibility. The use of operators like kubet can help increase efficiency and reproducibility in your organization by standardizing how applications are deployed on Kubernetes. This can help reduce errors and improve productivity.

Kubet is a handy tool that you can use to deploy, manage, and monitor Kubernetes applications from your mobile device. You can use Kubet to create and manage clusters, pods, services, and other resources. Kubet also provides tools for debugging and troubleshooting your Kubernetes applications.

To install Kubet on your mobile device, visit the Google Play Store or the App Store. Once you have installed Kubet, open it and sign in with your Google account or Apple ID. After you have signed in, you will be presented with the Kubet home screen.

The first thing you will want to do is create a new cluster. To do this, tap the + icon in the top right corner of the screen. You will then be prompted to enter information about your new cluster. Enter a name for your cluster and select a region. Then tap Create.

Once your cluster is created, you can start deploying applications to it. To do this, tap the + icon in the top left corner of the screen and select Add Pod. Enter the details for your new pod and tap Create.

Your pod will now be created and you can start using it to deploy applications. You can also use Kubet to monitor your Kubernetes applications. To do this, tap the Monitoring tab at the bottom of the screen. Here you will see graphs depicting CPU usage, Memory usage, and Disk space usage for all of your active pods and services.
