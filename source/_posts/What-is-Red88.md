#  Where is Myanmar?

Myanmar is a Southeast Asian country that is bordered by India and Bangladesh to the west, Thailand and Laos to the east, and China to the north. The country became an independent republic in 1948, after being occupied by the British for more than a century.

Myanmar is home to over 100 different ethnic groups, each with their own distinct culture. The Burmese people make up the majority of the population and are considered Theravada Buddhists. Other major religions in Myanmar include Islam, Animism, and Christianity.

The country has a rich history and culture that is evident in its architecture, art, and cuisine. Yangon, the former capital city, is home to many ancient Buddhist temples and pagodas. In addition, there are many well-preserved colonial-era buildings in the city.

Myanmar's cuisine is heavily influenced by Indian and Chinese cuisine. Some common dishes include mohinga (a fish soup), samosa (a deep-fried pastry filled with vegetables or meat), and thukpa (a Tibetan noodle soup).

Although Myanmar is still a relatively undeveloped country, it offers tourists a unique glimpse into traditional Southeast Asian culture. There are many interesting places to visit in Myanmar, such as Bagan (an ancient city full of Buddhist temples) and Inle Lake (a beautiful lake dotted with traditional stilt houses).
