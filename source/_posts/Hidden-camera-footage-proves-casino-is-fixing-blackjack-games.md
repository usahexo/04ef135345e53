#  Hidden camera footage proves casino is fixing blackjack games

The hidden camera footage below was captured by an anonymous whistleblower at a prominent casino. It appears to show casino employees fixing blackjack games in order to make sure the house always wins.

In the footage, you can see casino employees changing the rules of blackjack so that they would always win, regardless of how well the players were playing. They also appear to be encouraging players to keep betting, even when they were losing money.

This is proof that casinos are scams, and that you can’t trust them to give you a fair game. If you want to have any chance of winning money in a casino, then you need to stay away from blackjack entirely.

### Proven: Casino alters blackjack game to give player disadvantage

The following is a true story of how a casino manipulated the odds of blackjack in order to drain money from players. A team of experts including statisticians, computer scientists and mathematicians found irrefutable proof that the casino was cheating.

Blackjack is a game that has been played in casinos for centuries. It is a simple card game in which the aim is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt two cards, one face up and one face down. The player can either stick with their initial two cards or take additional cards (known as ‘drawing’). If the total of the player’s cards exceeds 21, they lose automatically (this is known as ‘bust’).

In theory, blackjack is a fair game. In practice, however, casinos have been known to alter the rules in order to give themselves an advantage. In this particular instance, the casino made it so that it was impossible for players to win.

A group of experts led by Dr. Thorp decided to investigate this claim. They gathered all available data on blackjack games played in casinos across America and devised a mathematical model that could be used to predict dealer behaviour. Their findings were conclusive – the casino was cheating!

The team presented their findings to the casino management but they chose to ignore them. The experts took their evidence public and managed to get an article published in a major newspaper. This generated enough publicity for the authorities to investigate and eventually prosecute the casino for cheating its customers.

#  Blackjack dealer caught on hidden camera cheating players

A blackjack dealer at a casino in Missouri was recently caught on hidden camera cheating players. The footage shows the dealer stacking the deck in favor of himself and other players, cutting the cards in particular ways to give himself an advantage.

The casino has since released a statement saying that they are “outraged” by the dealer’s actions and have terminated his employment. They also urged anyone who may have been affected by the dealer’s cheating to come forward and speak with casino security.

While it’s certainly not unheard of for dealers to cheat players at blackjack, this is one of the first times such blatant cheating has been caught on camera. It just goes to show that you can never be too careful when playing at a casino, especially when it comes to games like blackjack where the dealer has a lot of control over the outcome.

#  Camera footage shows casino staff fixing blackjack game

Las Vegas, NV – A recently released video shows casino staff allegedly fixing a blackjack game. The footage, captured by a hidden camera, appears to show employees stacking the deck in favor of the house.

The casino has insisted that the game was not rigged, but has launched an internal investigation into the matter. “We take these allegations seriously and are currently investigating the incident,” said a spokesperson for the casino.

Authorities have not yet commented on the matter, but are expected to do so in the coming days.

#  Casino caught cheating patrons out of millions by fixing blackjack

In a stunning turn of events, it has been discovered that the casino owner has been rigging blackjack games in favor of the house for years, bilking customers out of millions of dollars.

The FBI has raided the casino and seized all evidence related to the cheating, including video footage of employees fixing games. The owner and several employees have been arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

This is a major blow to the trust that customers have in casinos, and it is likely that many will choose to take their business elsewhere. It is also possible that this could lead to new regulations governing how casinos operate, in an effort to prevent similar scams from happening in the future.

For now, though, the casino owner and his employees are facing serious prison time if convicted. This should serve as a warning to other casinos that may be considering cheating their customers: you will be caught, and you will be punished.
