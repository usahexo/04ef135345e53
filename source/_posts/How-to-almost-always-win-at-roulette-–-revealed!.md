#  How to almost always win at roulette – revealed!

If you love casino games, but don’t want to risk too much money, roulette is definitely the game for you! All you need is a bit of knowledge on how to play it and you can walk away with a nice profit – even on a winning streak. So, read on for our top tips on how to almost always win at roulette!

1. Choose European Roulette

There’s no difference in the odds between European and American roulette – but the house edge is significantly lower in European roulette. This means that over time, you’ll have a higher chance of winning playing European roulette.

2. Stick to even money bets

The simplest way to increase your chances of winning at roulette is to stick to even money bets, such as red or black, odd or even, and 1-18 or 19-36. These bets have an almost 50/50 chance of winning, so they’re a great starting point for beginners.

3. Avoid outside bets

While they offer bigger payouts, outside bets like columns and dozens have a much lower chance of winning than even money bets. So unless you’re feeling lucky, it’s best to avoid them altogether.

4. Use progressive betting systems

If you want to increase your chances of winning even further, try using a progressive betting system like the Martingale system. This system involves increasing your bet size after each loss until you eventually win, which will then cover all previous losses plus earn you some profit on top!

#  Guaranteed way to beat the casino at roulette every time

There is a guaranteed way to beat the casino at roulette every time. The method is simple – bet on black every time. This strategy may not seem like the most exciting, but it is a tried and true way to make money at the roulette table.

In order to make this strategy work, you will need to place your bets before the wheel is spun. This means that you cannot wait until after the ball lands to see what color it lands on – you have to place your bets ahead of time. If you are feeling lucky, you can also bet on red as well. However, black is statistically more likely to come up, so that is the better bet.

Another thing to keep in mind when using this strategy is that you should never change your bet size. Place the same amount of chips on black each time – this will help you stay disciplined and increase your chances of winning.

The key to making this strategy work is patience. You may not win every single game, but over time, you will come out ahead. So if you want to make some easy money at the casino, consider using this strategy at roulette!

#  How to cheat the roulette wheel and make money 4. The one simple rule to always follow when playing roulette 

If you're looking to make some easy money, roulette is the game for you. While there is no foolproof strategy when playing, there are a few simple rules that can help you increase your chances of winning.

The first and most important rule is to never bet on black or red. This may seem like common sense, but many players make the mistake of betting on their favourite colour without giving any other options a chance. By betting on black or red, you're basically just giving the casino a 50/50 chance of winning your money.

Instead, try betting on Odd or Even. This gives you a better chance of winning as the odds are slightly in your favour. Alternatively, you could also bet on specific numbers. Just be sure to do your research first and select a number that has a low probability of coming up.

No matter what strategy you choose to follow, always remember the one simple rule: never bet on black or red.

# 5. How to have almost a 100% success rate playing roulette

There is no 100% guarantee in roulette, but you can come close by following a few simple tips.

1. Choose European Roulette

The odds are marginally better in European roulette, meaning you have a slightly better chance of winning.

2. Stick to Even Bets

Bet on evens amounts only- this will help ensure you don’t lose your money too quickly and give you more chances to win.

3. Place Your Bets on the Outside Only

By betting on the outside of the table, you decrease your chances of losing money, while still having a chance to win big.

4. Have Patience!

Roulette is a game of patience- if you bet all your money in one go, you’re likely to lose it all. Spread your bets over time and increase your chances or winning overall.
