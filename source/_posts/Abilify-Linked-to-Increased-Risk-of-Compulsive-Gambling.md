#  Abilify Linked to Increased Risk of Compulsive Gambling

The antipsychotic drug Abilify (aripiprazole) has been linked to a heightened risk of compulsive gambling, according to a study published in The Lancet.

Researchers analyzed data from individuals aged 16-64 who had been prescribed Abilify between 2006 and 2009. They found that the risk of compulsively gambling was approximately three times higher in those taking Abilify than in those not taking the drug.

The findings support previous research showing that Abilify may increase the risk of impulse-control problems. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning about the risk of “pathological gambling” with Abilify and other drugs in its class known as atypical antipsychotics.

Experts say that patients taking Abilify should be warned about the potential for developing compulsive behaviors, including gambling. If you or someone you know is taking Abilify and experiences signs of compulsive behavior, such as excessive spending, gambling, or eating, it is important to seek medical help immediately.

#  Abilify May Increase Risk of Addiction, Including Compulsive Gambling

A new study has found that Abilify, a drug approved to treat bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and depression, may increase the risk of addiction, including compulsive gambling.

The study, which was published in JAMA Psychiatry, looked at data from nearly 92,000 patients who were prescribed Abilify between 2002 and 2014. The researchers found that those who were prescribed Abilify were more likely to develop an addiction to gambling than those who weren’t prescribed the drug.

They also found that the risk of addiction was highest in the first year after being prescribed Abilify and that the risk was greater among men and those who were younger.

Abilify is a type of medication known as a “second-generation antipsychotic” or “atypical antipsychotic.” It works by blocking certain receptors in the brain that are involved in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Abilify is one of the most commonly prescribed psychiatric drugs in the United States. In 2013 alone, it was estimated to have been prescribed to more than 9 million people.

The findings of this study are concerning, given that Abilify is such a commonly used drug. They suggest that patients and doctors should be aware of the potential for addiction with Abilify and take steps to prevent it from happening.

If you are taking Abilify or are considering taking it, be sure to talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of doing so.

#  Could Abilify Cause You to Gamble compulsively?

Abilify (aripiprazole) is a medication used to treat a variety of mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. While it can be an effective treatment for some, there is evidence that it may also cause gambling compulsions in some people.

Gambling compulsions are characterized by an uncontrollable urge to gamble and continued gambling even after suffering significant financial losses. They can be extremely destructive both financially and emotionally, and often lead to ruined relationships and careers.

There have been several reports of gambling compulsions in people taking Abilify, including one case where a patient lost over $250,000 due to his gambling addiction. In another case, a man who had never gambled before began gambling compulsively soon after starting Abilify treatment.

So far, there is only anecdotal evidence linking Abilify to gambling compulsions. However, given that the drug has been linked to other compulsive behaviors such as binge eating and shopping, it's possible that it may also cause gambling compulsions in some people.

If you are taking Abilify and feel like you are unable to control your urge to gamble, it is important to speak with your doctor immediately. There may be other treatments available that can help manage your condition without the risk of developing a gambling addiction.

#  Study Links Abilify to Increased compulsive gambling behaviors

A study published by the Harvard Medical School has linked the drug Abilify to increased compulsive gambling behaviors in patients. The study, which is set to be published in the October edition of The American Journal of Psychiatry, states that among the 47,000 patients studied taking Abilify at some point from 2002 to 2009, 1,300 (or 2.8%) developed a gambling problem.

 Abilify is a prescription medication used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. It is also approved for the treatment of irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years. In 2013 sales of Abilify reached $6.5 billion globally.

In February of this year, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., the Japanese drugmaker that manufactures Abilify, warned doctors about an increased risk of compulsive or uncontrollable urges like gambling, sexual behavior and eating in patients taking the drug. This warning came after the FDA issued a safety alert on January 31st stating that it was reviewing reports of compulsive or uncontrollable urges in patients taking psychiatric medications like Abilify, Seroquel and Zyprexa.

The increase in reported cases of compulsive behavior in patients taking these drugs has been linked to their use for off-label purposes such as treating conditions like ADHD and Alzheimer’s disease. All three drugs are approved to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder but are also commonly prescribed for other disorders despite a lack of evidence that they are effective for those conditions.

Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., said at the time that it was updating the labels on its products to reflect the changes but did not pull them from pharmacies. A company spokesperson said that “the benefits of Abilify when used as prescribed continue to outweigh its risks” and that “Otsuka takes patient safety very seriously”.

#  Abilify May Raise Risk of Compulsive Gambling, Study Finds

A new study has found that the antidepressant Abilify may raise the risk of compulsive gambling.

The study, which was published in The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, looked at data from over 9,000 patients who were treated with Abilify between 2002 and 2015.

The researchers found that the risk of compulsive gambling was 4.5 times higher for patients who were treated with Abilify than for those who were not.

They also found that the risk was highest among patients who were taken the highest doses of the drug.

Abilify is a prescription medication that is used to treat mental health conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.

It is a common drug, with over 31 million prescriptions written for it in the United States in 2015.

The researchers say that the findings should cause doctors to be more cautious about prescribing Abilify to patients who are at risk for compulsive gambling.

"This study provides important information for both clinicians and patients about the potential risks associated with ABILIFY use," said senior author Dr. Philip Gorwood in a statement. "Because there is a high rate of both psychiatric disorders and gambling problems in the general population, it is important for physicians to consider these risks when prescribing ABILIFY."
