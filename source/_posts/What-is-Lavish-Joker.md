#  What is Lavish Joker Game?

Lavish joker game is a new casino game that has been designed to give players an immersive and entertaining experience. This game is played with a deck of 52 cards, and the objective is to collect as many points as possible by forming poker hands. The game can be played by one or two players, and there are different variants that can be enjoyed.

# How to Play

The basic rules of the game are as follows:

1. The player must first shuffle the deck of cards.
2. The player then draws five cards from the deck and sets them face down in front of them. 
3. The player then flips over the top card of their stack, and this becomes the first card in their hand. 
4. Play then proceeds clockwise, with each player taking one turn per round. 
5. On a player's turn, they must either place one card from their hand on to the table, or pick up all the cards currently on the table and add them to their hand (except for the joker, which remains on the table). 
6. If at any time a player has four cards of the same rank (e.g. four kings), they may place all four cards on to the table to form a poker hand. 
7. The joker can be used as any other card in the deck, with the exception that it cannot be used to form a four-of-a-kind poker hand. 
8. The winner is determined by counting up the total value of all of the poker hands formed during the game (according to standard Poker rankings). The player with the highest total score is declared the winner.

There are also some additional rules that apply specifically to joker games:
1. If at any time there are no more cards left in the deck, then play immediately ends and whoever has most points wins (even if they have not yet had a turn). 
2 . If two or more players have equal points at the end of a joker game, then whoever has collected more jokers wins (Jokers are worth 10 points each).
