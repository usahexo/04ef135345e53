One such strategy is called the “soft hands” strategy, and it is particularly useful for players who are new to the game or those who are not very confident in their card-counting skills.</p>
<p>Essentially, the soft hands strategy involves playing hands that contain an Ace as their first card in a different way from other hands. With this strategy, you should always split a pair of Aces and also double down when you have a hand total of 11. You should also stand with a hand total of 17 or more, regardless of the cards that are currently in your hand.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind this strategy is that the Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11, which gives you more flexibility when making decisions about how to play your hand. By splitting pairs of Aces and doubling down with strong totals, you can increase your chances of winning without taking on too much risk.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this strategy only applies to hands that contain an Ace as their first card. If you have another card (or cards) alongside the Ace, then you should still use basic blackjack strategy to make your decisions.</p>

Here are a few tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Try to stay away from splitting pairs. Splitting pairs can often lead to big losses, so it is best to avoid it if possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep track of the cards that have been played. This will help you to better understand what cards are still left in the deck and whether or not you should hit or stand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be aware of the dealer’s up card. If the dealer has an ace showing, be especially careful about whether or not you should hit or stand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use basic blackjack strategy to guide your decisions. This will give you the best chance of winning, regardless of the hand that you are holding.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these tips, you can increase your chances of winning at blackjack when you have a soft hand.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-a-soft-hand-in-blackjack-and-how-do-you-use-it"><a href="#What-is-a-soft-hand-in-blackjack-and-how-do-you-use-it" class="headerlink" title="What is a soft hand in blackjack and how do you use it?"></a>What is a soft hand in blackjack and how do you use it?</h1><p>A soft hand is one that includes an Ace. When you are dealt a soft hand, you can hit as many times as you want without going bust, since the Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11. You should only stand when your total reaches 17 or more (since an Ace can count as 1 or 11, your total could reach 18 and still be safe to hit). </p>
<p>If you have a soft hand, always take into account whether you would go bust if you hit again. For example, if you have an Ace and a 2, hitting again would give you a total of 3 which is still below 18 (the safe hit point). However, if you have an Ace and a 7, hitting again would give you a total of 8 which is above 18 and therefore not safe to hit.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Strategy-How-to-Play-Soft-Hands"><a href="#Blackjack-Strategy-How-to-Play-Soft-Hands" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Strategy: How to Play Soft Hands"></a>Blackjack Strategy: How to Play Soft Hands</h1><p>One of the most important aspects of blackjack strategy is knowing how to play soft hands. A soft hand is any hand that includes an Ace, because the Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11. When you have a soft hand, you need to decide how to play it based on the other cards in your hand and the dealer’s upcard.</p>
<p>The basic strategy for playing soft hands is to always hit if your total is less than 17, and to stand if your total is 17 or more. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, if you have an Ace and a 2, you should hit even if your total is 17 or more, because you have a better chance of getting a good hand like a 21. If you have an Ace and a 3, on the other hand, you should stand if your total is 17 or more, because there’s a good chance that the next card will be a low number and your total will go over 21.</p>
<p>As with all blackjack strategy, it’s important to keep track of what the dealer is showing and make decisions accordingly. If the dealer has a low card showing (2 through 6), you should generally hit even if your total is 17 or more. But if the dealer has a high card showing (7 through Ace), you should stand no matter what your total is.</p>
<p>By using these basic guidelines for playing soft hands, you can improve your chances of winning at blackjack.</p>
<h1 id="Learn-How-to-Play-Soft-Hands-at-Blackjack-for-Greater-Winning-Opportunities"><a href="#Learn-How-to-Play-Soft-Hands-at-Blackjack-for-Greater-Winning-Opportunities" class="headerlink" title="Learn How to Play Soft Hands at Blackjack for Greater Winning Opportunities"></a>Learn How to Play Soft Hands at Blackjack for Greater Winning Opportunities</h1><p>When visiting a casino, one of the ways to increase your chances of winning is to play soft hands at blackjack. In order to understand how to play these more advantageous hands, you first must understand how they are played and the basic rules of blackjack.</p>
<p>In blackjack, the aim of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (a blackjack), or by reaching a total that is higher than the dealer’s total without going over 21. In order to win, your hand must be greater than the dealer’s hand without going over 21.</p>
<p>There are different ways to score points in blackjack, with cards 2 through 9 worth their face value, 10s and Picture Cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) worth 10 points each, and an Ace can be worth 1 or 11 points.</p>
<p>When you are dealt your first two cards, you will either have a soft hand or a hard hand. A soft hand occurs when one of your two initial cards is an Ace, as this can be counted as 1 or 11 points depending on what is needed for the particular hand. A hard hand occurs when both of your initial cards are not Aces.</p>
<p>Now that you understand what a soft hand is, let’s take a look at some of the best plays for these types of hands:<br>-Stand if your total is 17 or higher<br>-Hit if your total is 16 or lower<br>-Double down if you have 11 points (or 10 points if the dealer shows a card worth 10)<br>-Split a pair of 7s or any pair where both cards are equal in value<br>-Stand on any 3 Card Hand that totals 17 or more </p>
