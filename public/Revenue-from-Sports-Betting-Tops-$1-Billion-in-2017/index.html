        <h1 id="Revenue-from-Sports-Betting-Tops-1-Billion-in-2017"><a href="#Revenue-from-Sports-Betting-Tops-1-Billion-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="Revenue from Sports Betting Tops $1 Billion in 2017"></a>Revenue from Sports Betting Tops $1 Billion in 2017</h1><p>Total wagers placed on sports in the United States reached $5.5 billion in 2017, with $1.2 billion of that coming from legal sports betting, according to a new study commissioned by the American Gaming Association (AGA) and released today. The scale of the U.S. sports betting market underscores the potential for states and tribes to generate new revenue and jobs from this growing industry.</p>
<p>“This report makes it clear: Americans are betting on sports at unprecedented levels,” said Bill Miller, president and CEO of the AGA. “鈥淚t鈥檚 time for lawmakers to recognize that gaming is a mainstream entertainment option that consumers want and deserve, and to empower states and tribes to bring these products to market. This will create jobs and new economic opportunities in local communities nationwide.”</p>
<p>The full report, 鈥淓xploring the Size and Scope of the Sports Betting Market in America,鈥� is available at americangaming.org&#x2F;sportsbettingmarket.</p>
<p>The study found that 94 million Americans – more than 40 percent of the population – bet on sports last year. Of those bets, only 3 percent were placed with a licensed Nevada sportsbook. The other 97 percent were placed with illegal bookmakers or offshore operators.</p>
<p>Given that an estimated $150 billion is wagered on sports each year in the U.S., there is significant potential for states and tribes to capture a share of this market by regulating and taxing legal sports betting. In New Jersey, for example, forecasts indicate that regulated sports betting could generate nearly $1 billion in new revenue over 10 years.</p>
<p>Revenue from legal sports betting would help states offset budget deficits while also funding important public priorities such as education, infrastructure and health care. It would also create jobs in the gaming industry and its supply chain, including marketing, information technology, security and customer service positions</p>
<h1 id="More-than-Half-of-All-US-States-Have-Legalized-Sports-Betting"><a href="#More-than-Half-of-All-US-States-Have-Legalized-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="More than Half of All US States Have Legalized Sports Betting"></a>More than Half of All US States Have Legalized Sports Betting</h1><p>According to a report from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/406456-graham-america-is-ready-for-sports-gambling">Hill</a>, more than half of all US states have legalized sports betting in some form or another. This is a clear sign that the American people are ready for widespread sports betting, as evidenced by the fact that more and more states are moving to legalize it.</p>
<p>Of course, there are still many opponents of sports betting, and they will undoubtedly fight tooth and nail to keep it illegal. But with more and more states moving to legalize it, it’s only a matter of time before sports betting is legal nationwide. And that’s good news for the American people, who will finally be able to bet on their favorite sports without having to worry about breaking the law.</p>
<p>So far, Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, and West Virginia have legalized full-scale sports betting, while Colorado, Missouri, and Pennsylvania have legalized it in a limited capacity. And there are sure to be many more states joining the bandwagon in the near future.</p>
<p>The fact that so many states are legalizing sports betting is a clear sign that Americans want it, and they aren’t going to take no for an answer. So if you’re one of those people who has been waiting for nationwide sports betting legalization, your wait is almost over. Keep an eye on your state legislature; you may see sports betting legalization bills being introduced in the near future.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Becomes-First-State-to-Launch-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Delaware-Becomes-First-State-to-Launch-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Becomes First State to Launch Sports Betting"></a>Delaware Becomes First State to Launch Sports Betting</h1><p>After several years of legal battles, Delaware has become the first state to offer full sports betting. On June 5th, Delaware’s three racinos (race tracks with attached casinos) started taking wagers on professional and college games.</p>
<p>“This is a great day for Delaware,” said Governor John Carney. “Our state has been at the forefront of gaming and betting technology for decades, and we are excited to now offer our residents and visitors the opportunity to bet on sports.”</p>
<p>Sports betting is big business, and Delaware is hoping to capitalize on the $150 billion that’s already being bet illegally each year. The state has already signed agreements with five of the country’s largest bookmakers, including FanDuel and DraftKings.</p>
<p>“ Delaware has always been a leader in gaming innovation,” said Bryan Engelhardt of DraftKings. “We’re excited to work with the state to bring our product to market and provide fans with another way to enjoy their favorite sports.”</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy about Delaware’s decision, however. The NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, and NCAA have all filed suit against the state, arguing that sports betting violates federal law.</p>
<p>“States cannot simply ignore federal law and allow gambling on sporting events,” said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. “We intend to enforce our rights through all appropriate legal means.”</p>
<p>Delaware is standing its ground, however, and plans to continue offering sports betting despite the opposition.</p>
<h1 id="NJSportsBetting-com-Sees-Huge-Traffic-on-First-Day-of-Legality"><a href="#NJSportsBetting-com-Sees-Huge-Traffic-on-First-Day-of-Legality" class="headerlink" title="NJSportsBetting.com Sees Huge Traffic on First Day of Legality"></a>NJSportsBetting.com Sees Huge Traffic on First Day of Legality</h1><p>Thursday was a big day for the New Jersey sports betting market, with traffic to NJSportsBetting.com spiking by more than 1400% compared to an average day in November.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t have asked for a better start,” said Matt Primeaux, Director of Marketing at NJSportsBetting.com. “People are clearly excited to have legal and regulated sports betting in New Jersey.”</p>
<p>NJSportsBetting.com is the only site offering legal online sports betting in the state, and it has the largest selection of wagers available, including pre-match and in-play betting on football, basketball, baseball, hockey, and other major sports.</p>
<p> interest in njsportsbetting has been high all week long in new jersey as people awaited the kickoff of thursday night’s nfl games. on wednesday, the site had its second-busiest day ever, with over $1 million in bets placed.</p>
<p>New Jersey is one of several states that recently legalized sports betting following a landmark supreme court decision earlier this year. Other states that have launched legal sports betting include nevada, delaware, mississippi, pennsylvania, and west virginia.</p>
<h1 id="NFL-Commissioner-Roger-Goodell-Calls-for-Changes-in-Sports-Gambling-Laws"><a href="#NFL-Commissioner-Roger-Goodell-Calls-for-Changes-in-Sports-Gambling-Laws" class="headerlink" title="NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell Calls for Changes in Sports Gambling Laws"></a>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell Calls for Changes in Sports Gambling Laws</h1><p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is asking United States lawmakers to pass legislation that would enable sports gambling across states. In testimony given to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Goodell said the NFL supports regulated sports betting as a way to protect the integrity of the sport.</p>
<p>“We are asking for a model that protects the integrity of our sport and includes appropriate consumer protections,” Goodell said in his testimony. “It is important that we get this right.”</p>
<p>Goodell’s comments come as several states have moved to legalize sports betting in recent years, including Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia. The Supreme Court is also considering a case that could pave the way for legalized sports betting nationwide.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to game-fixing and other corruption, while supporters say it would create new revenues for state governments and help keep fans engaged in sporting events.</p>
<p>In his testimony, Goodell said the NFL has created “robust” rules and procedures to protect the integrity of its games, but admitted that more needs to be done.</p>
<p>“There is no question that we need comprehensive federal legislation,” he said. “The laws governing gaming are antiquated and must be updated to reflect modern times.”</p>
