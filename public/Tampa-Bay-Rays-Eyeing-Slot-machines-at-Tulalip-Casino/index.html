        <h1 id="Tampa-Bay-Rays-Eyeing-Slot-machines-at-Tulalip-Casino"><a href="#Tampa-Bay-Rays-Eyeing-Slot-machines-at-Tulalip-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Tampa Bay Rays Eyeing Slot machines at Tulalip Casino"></a>Tampa Bay Rays Eyeing Slot machines at Tulalip Casino</h1><p>Wednesday, the Tampa Bay Rays made an unexpected appearance at the Tulalip Casino in Washington state. In attendance were owner Stu Sternberg and several members of the Rays management team. The stated purpose of the visit was to explore the possibility of obtaining a gambling license so that the team could install slot machines at the casino.</p>
<p>The potential move comes as no surprise to those familiar with Sternberg’s business practices. The Rays owner has a history of seeking new and innovative ways to increase revenue for his team. In addition to slot machines, Sternberg has also explored the possibility of selling naming rights to Tropicana Field and creating a regional sports network.</p>
<p>If approved, the Rays would become only the second Major League Baseball team to operate their own casino. The first was the Milwaukee Brewers, who partnered with the Potawatomi tribe in Milwaukee to open a casino in late 2014.</p>
<p>There is no set timeline for when a decision on the Rays’ application will be made, but casino officials say they expect a ruling within the next few months.</p>
<h1 id="Tampa-Bay-Rays-to-Play-at-Tulalip-Casino-for-a-Night"><a href="#Tampa-Bay-Rays-to-Play-at-Tulalip-Casino-for-a-Night" class="headerlink" title="Tampa Bay Rays to Play at Tulalip Casino for a Night"></a>Tampa Bay Rays to Play at Tulalip Casino for a Night</h1><p>The Tampa Bay Rays announced they will be playing a game at the Tulalip Casino in Marysville, Washington on September 25th. The game will be part of a special promotion where fans can win a chance to play alongside the Rays players on the field.</p>
<p>“We are really excited to play at the Tulalip Casino,” said Rays outfielder Kevin Kiermaier. “It’s going to be a lot of fun to play in front of some new fans and help celebrate their casino’s opening.”</p>
<p>The Rays will be playing the Seattle Mariners in the game, which is being touted as the “Tulalip Casino Bash.” The casino is opening its new location next week and is looking to promote its gaming and hospitality offerings.</p>
<p>The game will also serve as a warm-up for the Rays, who are currently in contention for a playoff spot in the American League. They enter Tuesday night’s action just 1.5 games back of first place Boston Red Sox and 2.0 games back of second place New York Yankees in the AL East Division standings.</p>
<p>Tickets for the game at Tulalip Casino went on sale on Monday and are expected to sell out quickly. Fans can purchase tickets through Ticketmaster or at the casino’s box office.</p>
<h1 id="Tulalip-Casino-adds-over-300-new-slot-machines"><a href="#Tulalip-Casino-adds-over-300-new-slot-machines" class="headerlink" title="Tulalip Casino adds over 300 new slot machines"></a>Tulalip Casino adds over 300 new slot machines</h1><p>In March 2017, the Tulalip Casino in Marysville, Washington, added over 300 new slot machines to its gaming floor. The new slots are a mix of traditional three-reel and five-reel games as well as interactive bonus games.</p>
<p>The casino has also installed a new player tracking system that allows guests to accumulate points and receive rewards for their play. Previously, the casino offered only rewards for table game players.</p>
<p>Guests at the Tulalip Casino can now enjoy such games as Wheel of Fortune, Star Trek: Against All Odds, and Furiously Furious. There is also a machine that simulates the experience of playing blackjack against a live dealer.</p>
<p>The Tulalip Casino is one of the largest casinos in Washington state, with more than 2,500 slot machines and 150 table games. It is owned and operated by the Tulalip Tribes of Washington.</p>
<h1 id="Tampa-Bay-Rays-Looking-to-Fill-Some-Slot-Machines"><a href="#Tampa-Bay-Rays-Looking-to-Fill-Some-Slot-Machines" class="headerlink" title="Tampa Bay Rays Looking to Fill Some Slot Machines"></a>Tampa Bay Rays Looking to Fill Some Slot Machines</h1><p>The Tampa Bay Rays are coming off a tough season where they finished in fourth place in the AL East. However, the squad has made some offseason moves that have them poised to rebound.</p>
<p>One of their main goals this season will be to fill some of the vacant slot machines around the infield. With Matt Duffy, Adeiny Hechavarria, and Wilson Ramos all departing via free agency, there are a few holes to fill.</p>
<p>The Rays believe that Willy Adames is ready to take over as the everyday shortstop. The 22-year-old has shown promise in his first two seasons in the major leagues and is expected to take another step forward this year.</p>
<p>At second base, they are planning on using Daniel Robertson and Joey Wendle interchangeably. Robertson had a breakout season in 2018, while Wendle showed flashes of brilliance after being acquired from the Cleveland Indians last offseason.</p>
<p>At first base, they will likely go with Ji-Man Choi who impressed towards the end of last season. Choi produced a .907 OPS in September and October and is looking to build on that success in 2019.</p>
<p>Some other players who could see time at those infield positions include Christian Arroyo, Brandon Lowe, and Michael Brosseau. Arroyo is coming off an injury-plagued season but is still considered one of Tampa Bay’s top prospects. Lowe had a strong rookie campaign last year while Brosseau put up some impressive numbers in AAA last season.</p>
<p>The Rays also have some options available in the outfield. Tommy Pham was acquired from the St. Louis Cardinals midway through last season and is expected to be their primary right fielder. Austin Meadows was acquired from the Pittsburgh Pirates in the same trade and should see plenty of action in left field. Other outfielders who could see time include Kevin Kiermaier, Mallex Smith, and Guillermo Heredia.</p>
<p>Despite losing some key players this offseason, the Rays are still confident that they can compete for a playoff spot in 2019. They have depth at most positions and plenty of young talent that is ready to make an impact at the major league level</p>
<h1 id="Tampa-Bay-Rays-to-Play-at-Tulalip-Casino-in-2019"><a href="#Tampa-Bay-Rays-to-Play-at-Tulalip-Casino-in-2019" class="headerlink" title="Tampa Bay Rays to Play at Tulalip Casino in 2019"></a>Tampa Bay Rays to Play at Tulalip Casino in 2019</h1><p>The Tampa Bay Rays announced they will play a game at the Tulalip Casino in 2019.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Tulalip Casino and bring Major League Baseball action to their venue,” said Rays President Brian Auld. “It will be a unique experience for our fans and an opportunity to showcase our organization to a new market.”</p>
<p>The game will take place on Tuesday, July 30, and marks the first time that a MLB team has played in Washington state.</p>
<p>The Rays are coming off of a disappointing 2018 season where they finished with a record of 80-82. This will be their 25th season in Tampa Bay.</p>
