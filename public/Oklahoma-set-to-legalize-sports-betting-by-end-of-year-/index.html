        <h1 id="Oklahoma-set-to-legalize-sports-betting-by-end-of-year"><a href="#Oklahoma-set-to-legalize-sports-betting-by-end-of-year" class="headerlink" title="Oklahoma set to legalize sports betting by end of year"></a>Oklahoma set to legalize sports betting by end of year</h1><p>Oklahoma is set to legalize sports betting by the end of the year, according to state officials.</p>
<p>“By the end of the year, we will have a gaming bill on the governor’s desk that allows for sports betting in Oklahoma,” state Sen. Greg Treat (R) said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The bill would allow bookmakers to take bets on professional and collegiate sporting events. However, it would not allow betting on high school games.</p>
<p>If enacted, Oklahoma would become the latest state to legalize some form of sports gambling. The Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned most sports betting last May, sparking a flurry of legislative action in states across the country.</p>
<p>According to industry analysts, Oklahoma has the potential to be a major player in the sports gambling market. The state has estimated annual gaming revenue of $2.3 billion, with $157 million coming from illegal wagers. Legalizing and regulating sports betting could bring in an additional $25 million annually, officials say.</p>
<p>While there is broad support for legalization among elected officials, not everyone is on board. Some religious leaders have expressed concerns about the social costs of gambling and argue that it can lead to addiction and financial ruin for many people.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, momentum seems to be moving in favor of legalization. In November, voters in Arkansas approved a ballot measure legalizing sports betting. And earlier this month, New Jersey became the first state to offer legal Sports Betting outside of Nevada.</p>
<h1 id="State-of-Oklahoma-nearing-deal-to-legalize-sports-betting"><a href="#State-of-Oklahoma-nearing-deal-to-legalize-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="State of Oklahoma nearing deal to legalize sports betting"></a>State of Oklahoma nearing deal to legalize sports betting</h1><p>Oklahoma is close to reaching a deal that would legalize sports betting in the state, according to multiple reports.</p>
<p>The deal would allow casinos in Oklahoma to take sports bets and operate wagering kiosks, with the possibility of online betting in the future. The move could bring in millions of dollars in new revenue to the cash-strapped state.</p>
<p>“I think we’re getting pretty close on it,” said Rep. Kevin Wallace, who chairs the House budget committee. “It’s something that we’re definitely looking at because of the potential for new revenue.”</p>
<p>Legal Sports Report confirmed with a source familiar with the negotiations that an agreement is close but not finalized.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to be revenue-neutral for the state, meaning it won’t make money or lose money overall. That’s because lawmakers are looking to impose a fee on sportsbooks as well as tax payouts from winning bets.</p>
<p>Oklahoma is one of several states where legalization of sports betting is under consideration this year. A number of other states have already moved forward with legalizing sports betting since the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban last year.</p>
<p>Wallace said there was no specific timeline for a vote on a sports betting bill, but he expects it could happen this spring or summer.</p>
<h1 id="Oklahoma-moves-closer-to-legalizing-sports-betting"><a href="#Oklahoma-moves-closer-to-legalizing-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Oklahoma moves closer to legalizing sports betting"></a>Oklahoma moves closer to legalizing sports betting</h1><p>Oklahoma is one of the states that is currently considering the legalization of sports betting. A new bill that has been introduced in the state senate would allow for the legal, regulated sports betting.</p>
<p>The proposed bill would establish a gaming commission that would be responsible for licensing and regulating sports betting in the state. The commission would also be responsible for setting the rules and regulations for sports betting, as well as ensuring that all bets are placed fairly.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that legalizing sports betting would bring much-needed revenue to the state. They also argue that it would help to protect consumers and ensure that games are fair.</p>
<p>Critics of the bill argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other negative consequences. They also argue that it could have a negative impact on professional athletes and sporting events.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-betting-could-be-coming-to-Oklahoma-casinos-soon"><a href="#Sports-betting-could-be-coming-to-Oklahoma-casinos-soon" class="headerlink" title="Sports betting could be coming to Oklahoma casinos soon"></a>Sports betting could be coming to Oklahoma casinos soon</h1><p>After the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that barred most sports betting, individual states are now free to legalize it. This could mean big changes for the Oklahoma gambling market.</p>
<p>There is already some interest in bringing sports betting to the state’s casinos. One of the tribal casinos, the Osage Nation, is looking into offering sports betting. They are not alone – there is likely going to be competition among the tribal casinos to see who can offer the best sports betting experience.</p>
<p>Oklahoma is also home to a number of commercial casinos. It is still unclear if they will offer sports betting, but it is a possibility. In fact, the owner of one of the casinos recently testified in favor of legalizing sports betting in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The potential for legal sports betting in Oklahoma has caught the attention of other businesses as well. For example, a company that owns data on athletes and sporting events could do very well in a legalized sports betting market.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no word on when or even if sports betting will be legalized in Oklahoma. There is still some debate over how it should be regulated. However, with so much interest in bringing it to the state, it seems likely that some form of legalized sports betting will eventually arrive in Oklahoma casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Oklahoma-lawmakers-discuss-legalizing-sports-betting"><a href="#Oklahoma-lawmakers-discuss-legalizing-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Oklahoma lawmakers discuss legalizing sports betting"></a>Oklahoma lawmakers discuss legalizing sports betting</h1><p>Oklahoma lawmakers have started discussing the possibility of legalizing sports betting in the state. The move could generate new revenue for the state, as well as help regulate an industry that is currently operating in a legal grey area.</p>
<p>Under current law, Oklahomans are only allowed to bet on horse racing and certain other sporting events. However, this hasn’t stopped people from wagering on games online or through offshore operators. In fact, Oklahoma is thought to be one of the biggest markets for illegal gambling in the country.</p>
<p>State Rep. Carl Newton, who is leading the charge on legalizing sports betting in Oklahoma, believes that it is time for the state to get in on the action. “We need to bring this activity out of the shadows and into the light where it can be appropriately monitored and regulated,” he said.</p>
<p>The idea has already been met with opposition from some lawmakers, who argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates in the state. However, proponents of legalization argue that such problems already exist and are not going away anytime soon. They also point out that legalizing sports betting would provide much-needed revenue for the state government.</p>
<p>A recent study by Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming estimated that if Oklahoma legalized sports betting, it could generate up to $215 million per year in new revenue. That would represent a significant increase over the $19 million generated by legal gambling in the state last year.</p>
<p>Legalizing sports betting could also create new jobs in Oklahoma’s gaming industry. There are currently around 800 people employed in casinos and other gambling establishments in the state. If sports betting were legalized, that number could grow significantly as new casinos open up specifically devoted to accepting bets on sporting events.</p>
<p>So far there is no set timetable for when legislators may vote on a bill to legalize sports betting in Oklahoma. However, with states like New Jersey and Delaware moving forward with similar measures, it seems likely that Oklahoma will eventually follow suit.</p>
